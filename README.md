# 🛡️ ProcSentinel

**Automated Process Monitoring & Reporting System using Python**

ProcSentinel is a Python-based system monitoring project that collects information about running processes, identifies specific processes, maintains process logs, and automatically sends reports through email.

The project was developed as part of a journey to understand Python system programming, process management, file handling, automation, and email communication.

### Module Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Main.py` | Controls the complete monitoring workflow |
| `ProcessInfo.py` | Collects information about running processes |
| `SpecificProcessInfo.py` | Searches for a specific process |
| `LogFile.py` | Creates and maintains process logs |
| `MailLog.py` | Sends logs through email |

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **psutil** — Process and system information
- **schedule** — Task scheduling
- **smtplib** — Email communication
- **EmailMessage** — Email creation and attachments
- **os** — File and directory operations
- **sys** — Command-line arguments

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Start
  ↓
Collect Running Processes
  ↓
Display Process Information
  ↓
Search for Specific Process
  ↓
Generate Process Log
  ↓
Attach Log to Email
  ↓
Send Email Report
  ↓
Repeat Automatically
```

The system periodically executes the monitoring workflow and records the information of the requested process.

## ▶️ Running the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ProcSentinel.git
cd ProcSentinel
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install psutil schedule
```

### 3. Run the project

```bash
python Main.py <process_name> <log_directory> <recipient_email>
```

**Example:**

```bash
python Main.py python.exe Demo user@gmail.com
```

---

## 📊 Example Process Information

```
User Name    : user
Process Name : python.exe
Pid          : 12345
```

The selected process information is also stored in:

```
Demo/LogProcInfo.txt
```
